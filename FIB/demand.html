<h3>After designating who is to blame for the intolerable circumstances in which one finds oneself, demands are placed on this being to ameliorate the situation. While this stage may appear to be somewhat self-evident, it is important to note that in many cases, a demand may be presented in a much more benign fashion than the term connotes. Certainly demands can and often do take the form of extreme vocalizations of disapproval, or the well-placed scratch. However, ever-important contextual factors must always be considered. These may lead to a gentler, though no less insistent path of supplication, including such behaviors as lap-kneading, loud purring, head-butting, and ankle-rubbing, to name a few. 
<p>
Controversy surrounding this stage has been receiving much attention lately due to claims by other prominent FIB scholars that this stage fails to address the possibility of a demand being ignored or denied. However, supporters of this model are quick to point out that there has been a total absence of such results in any credible research to date. It appears that, in layman's terms, felines are not in the habit of taking no for an answer.

Once a demand has received a response, the next stage,
