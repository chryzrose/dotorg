<h3>Though rare, this stage may result when the response to a demand is determined to be appropriate as well as sufficient. Qualifying as either appropriate or sufficient has been determined repeatedly in studies to require that such responses go far beyond the mere mediocre and in fact, should entail excellence and high quality. Anything less will result in the stage of disdain. A response achieving the stage of delight has undoubtedly been generated through no small amount of effort and finesse. Signs that this stage has been entered are contented purring, complete relaxation, half-closed eyes, face-washing, and possible floor-rolling.<h3>

<h5 style=font-style:italic>(It has been noted that for a certain segment of the population, the ingesting of the substance "Nepeta cataria,"commonly known as catnip, may provide a kind of short-circuit path to experiencing this stage. Such use, of course, is not being here promoted, as long-term effects on health are unknown and short-term effects on behavior are at best unpredictable.)</h5>
