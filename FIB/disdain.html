<h3>Having determined through the process of discrimination that the response to one's dissatisfactory state is - well, dissatisfactory - this stage represents the utter contempt for such a failure. Noticeable behaviors exhibited in this stage may include twitching tails, looks of death, and offering views of one's back side. This stage nearly always results in a return to the stage of <a href="http://students.washington.edu/chryz/FIB/dissatisfaction.html"> DISSATISFACTION</a>. In fact, the two stages have been noted by many researchers to be almost indistinguishable.  However, disdain can only occur after having proceeded through the previous stages.</h3>
